## The Linked List Node

### Getting started

You are probably familiar with the `LinkedList` data structure from DSA lectures or other tutorials.

These materials usually present a `LinkedList` class that has many properties and methods: `push`, `pop`, `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `length`, `head`, `tail`, `isEmpty`, `remove`, etc.

The programming languages and libraries you use in real life probably make use of a premade `LinkedList` class that has all of these properties and methods.

But! In job interviews, you are almost never going to be given a `LinkedList` class like this. They also won't let you import an external linked list library.

In an interview, you aren't going to have time to create your own `LinkedList` class with all of its methods. That would be dozens or hundreds of lines of code that mostly don't help you solve the problem.

Instead, you will need to solve the problem using the simple but powerful `Node` class. Understanding the `Node` and all of things it can or cannot do is key to cracking these problems.

Things we'll discuss here:

- The `Node` class
- Quick review of classes and constructors
- Why the simple `Node` class is usually good enough for interview problems

### Exercises

1. Make your own linked lists in `makeList.js`
1. Make more linked lists from scratch in `fromScratch.js`
